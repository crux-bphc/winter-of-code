# Project Ideas

**NOTE** : *This page is being updated with new project ideas. Please keep checking regularly and stay in touch with the mentors listed [here](mentors).*

This is just a list of possible ideas to apply for in the Winter of Code and by no means a complete list.We suggest trying out directly for one of the existing open source organisations directly, but if you feel that it is too big a leap, you can start at a lesser difficulty and apply for one of the below projects/ideas, or bring up an idea of your own:

1. **[Zazu](https://github.com/tinytacoteam/zazu)** is a cross platform, fully extensible and open source launcher for hackers, creators and dabblers. The project is fairly active with a decent number of collaborators and is written in JavaScript.
2. **[FOSSASIA Mini Projects](https://github.com/fossasia/labs.fossasia.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amini-project)** are a good starting point for someone looking to apply for a GSoC project under FOSSASIA.
3. **[Zulip](https://chat.zulip.org)** is an open source group chat application written in Python and Javascript. The project is always ready to help out people in getting started with contributing, as well as providing a lot of experience in working in a thriving open source community that participates in various open source programs including GSoC each year. Some good first issues are [here](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee).
4. **[Fest Manager](https://github.com/crux-bphc/fest-manager)** is the system responsible for serving the fest websites of our college, including the Atmos website. If you feel intimidated by the prospect of working in an unfamiliar territory, you might want to try your hand at Fest Manager first, which has similar contributor experience as Zulip for the most part.
5. **[Crux Judge](https://crux-bphc.github.io/crux-judge/)** is a code judge in the making with the aim to phase out Mooshak from the college if it all goes well. Similar to Fest Manager, this project has the advantage of a good first project because it is a new codebase and is probably being worked on by people you are already familiar with.
6. **[Markdown Editor](https://github.com/aero31aero/markdown-editor/)** is a browser based editor with live preview. You can check it out [here](http://rohitt.me/markdown-editor). This project is soon going to be merged into its parent fork, which has hundreds of users everyday.
7. **[ABC Text Editor](https://github.com/v-superuser/text-editor)** is a vim-like text-editor written completely in C. It currently works as a text viewer only but we wish to increase it's functionality over winters by adding features like editing, syntax highlighting etc. It's a good project if you just learnt C and want to try out a new project.
8. **[CMS Android Application](https://github.com/crux-bphc/CMS-Android)** is the application that the whole campus uses to access CMS from their Android devices. The app is in need of some work and the road map is given [here](https://github.com/crux-bphc/CMS-Android/issues/25). However, if you feel there are other parts of the app that need focus as well, you are free to work on them.

If you are looking for more projects, check out the [last year's Google Summer of Code organisations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/) and explore around. It is perfectly fine to have a plan with the aim of getting started with the community and making 3 relevant fixes in the next 2 months to begin with.
