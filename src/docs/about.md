1. Get exposed to the program structure of Google Summer of Code.
2. Experience in writing a proposal and getting it reviewed from mentors who have been selected in similar programs.
3. Using Version Control System(git, svn) which is very crucial for almost all large-scale projects.
4. Experience collaborating on large codebases with other develoeprs and mentors.
5. Potential exposure to GSoC organizations depending on your proposal idea.

## How to Apply

To apply, you must submit a proposal to [crux@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in](mailto:crux@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in) latest by 30th November 2017, midnight.

You can take a look at a proposal template and sample proposals on the [proposal template page](proposal-template). It is recommended to use Google Docs, sending us a Docs link to your proposal with **atleast comment access** along with an exported PDF attached.

It is encouraged to submit work in progress(WIP) versions of your proposal before the submission deadine for suggestions and reviews by potential mentors.

We can only do justice to a limited number of candidates due to lack of mentors, therefore we will have scrutinize your proposals and select the best ones for the program. Please do not submit a proposal if you aren't sure about working in the winter vacations.

## Project Ideas

You can either choose to apply for one of the below projects/ideas, or bring up an idea of your own:

1. **[Zazu](https://github.com/tinytacoteam/zazu)** is a cross platform, fully extensible and open source launcher for hackers, creators and dabblers. The project is fairly active with a decent number of collaborators.
2. **[FOSSASIA Mini Projects](https://github.com/fossasia/labs.fossasia.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amini-project)** are a good starting point for someone looking to apply for a GSoC project under FOSSASIA.
