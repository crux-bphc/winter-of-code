3. Using Version Control System(git, svn) which is very crucial for almost all large-scale projects.
4. Experience collaborating on large codebases with other develoeprs and mentors.
5. Potential exposure to GSoC organizations depending on your proposal idea.

## How to Apply

To apply, you must submit a proposal to [crux@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in](mailto:crux@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in) latest by 30th November 2017, midnight.
