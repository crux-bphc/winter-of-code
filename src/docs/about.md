## How to Apply

To apply, you must submit a proposal to [crux@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in](mailto:crux@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in) latest by 30th November 2017, midnight.

It is encouraged to submit work in progress(WIP) versions of your proposal before the submission deadine for suggestions and reviews by potential mentors.

We can only do justice to a limited number of candidates due to lack of mentors, therefore we will have scrutinize your proposals and select the best ones for the program. Please do not submit a proposal if you aren't sure about working in the winter vacations.
