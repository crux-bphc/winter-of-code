<h1 id="project-ideas">Project Ideas</h1>
<p>This is just a list of possible ideas to apply for in the Winter of Code and by no means a complete list. You can either choose to apply for one of the below projects/ideas, or bring up an idea of your own:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/tinytacoteam/zazu">Zazu</a></strong> is a cross platform, fully extensible and open source launcher for hackers, creators and dabblers. The project is fairly active with a decent number of collaborators and is written in JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/fossasia/labs.fossasia.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amini-project">FOSSASIA Mini Projects</a></strong> are a good starting point for someone looking to apply for a GSoC project under FOSSASIA.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://chat.zulip.org">Zulip</a></strong> is an open source group chat application written in Python and Javascript. The project is always ready to help out people in getting started with contributing, as well as providing a lot of experience in working in a thriving open source community that participates in various open source programs including GSoC each year. Some good first issues are <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+no%3Aassignee">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/crux-bphc/fest-manager">Fest Manager</a></strong> is the system responsible for serving the fest websites of our college, including the Atmos website. If you feel intimidated by the prospect of working in an unfamiliar territory, you might want to try your hand at Fest Manager first, which has similar contributor experience as Zulip for the most part.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://crux-bphc.github.io/crux-judge/">Crux Judge</a></strong> is a code judge in the making with the aim to phase out Mooshak from the college if it all goes well. Similar to Fest Manager, this project has the advantage of a good first project because it is a new codebase and is probably being worked on by people you are already familiar with.</li>
</ol>
