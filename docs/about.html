<li>Get exposed to the program structure of Google Summer of Code.</li>
<li>Experience in writing a proposal and getting it reviewed from mentors who have been selected in similar programs.</li>
<li>Using Version Control System(git, svn) which is very crucial for almost all large-scale projects.</li>
<li>Experience collaborating on large codebases with other developers and mentors.</li>
<li>Potential exposure to GSoC organizations depending on your proposal idea.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
