<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>As a part of ATMOS, the technical festival of BITS Hyderabad, CRUx, the Programming and Computing club, organized the second edition of PyBITS. The 2-day event comprised of a Python conference and an introductory Python workshop, which was later followed by 2 advanced workshops. Both the segments were organized on the last two days of ATMOS (28th and 29th October) respectively. </p>
<p>CRUx, as a club, has always been concerned with the technical growth of students, and correspondingly organizes various workshops and events throughout the calendar year. As the club envisioned it last year, a Python conference makes an ideal platform to inspire and motivates students towards software development and maintenance, and also enables them to connect with real-world developers from across the city. </p>
<p>Having the general idea, an introductory Python workshop would then readily serve non-programmers to get handy with the language, and hence, to lower the entry barrier into the world of programming. To those with the expertise in the subject, the advanced workshops were mainly designed to introduce the new libraries and their applications in actual projects. As it has been observed, most developers in India start coding after joining college. So, by targeting the school students we hoped to get them started early with programming. </p>
<p>This year, as discussed at the end of the previous edition, we collaborated with HydPy community for mutual publicity of our events. We hope to continue to increase our collaboration and have plans to setup BITS Hyderabad as a potential meet-up location for the Hyderabad Python Community.</p>
<h3 id="the-conference">The Conference</h3>
<p>The Python conference had an attendance of 412, out of which 203 participants were from the host college itself, and the remainder constituted of BITS Alumnus community, enthusiastic students from schools and colleges across Hyderabad, and the working professionals in the field.</p>
<p>For the conference, a panel comprising of 5 speakers came over to deliver talks on their subject of excellence.</p>
<p>The conference started with Mr. Saikat Kumar Dey who spoke about building a chat-bot from scratch using open source tools. Next, Mr. Ramanathan Muthaiah gave an introduction to using Continuous Integration in Software Development.The highlight was the keynote session by Mr. Sunil Mohan Adapa about the Freedom Box project and also about our current dystopian world with pervasive data collection. He stressed on the importance of keeping our data and conversations safe and decentralized so that our fundamental right to privacy will not be violated.The conference concluded with Mr. Satish Rao providing an introduction to using Python in Internet of Things and a talk on Impact of Python on Data Science by Mr. Madhu Vadlamani.</p>
<p>Our speakers generally had just positive things to say in regards to our gathering. Talking to the panel post conference, Mr. Satish Rao commented that such events served as great opportunities to meet like-minded people, learn from their experiences, and eventually collaborate.</p>
<h3 id="the-workshops">The Workshops</h3>
<h4 id="basic-workshop">Basic Workshop</h4>
<p>Approaching the second part of the PyBITS occasion, the club organized the Basic Python workshop on the twenty-ninth of October, the passage to which was free of cost for the school students and with a nominal fee for college goers. The club members helped in reaching out to the schools all across Hyderabad and made sure of their conveyance to the campus. Also, the contingents from nearby colleges were invited to the whole event. Ultimately, it turned out that the endeavors in calling up such a huge number of institutions didn&#39;t go in vain as the turn-out was more than double from last year&#39;s. An aggregate of 252 students was thus seen seated in the workshop. Despite that, the operations and logistics remained smooth thanks to the planning of the management. </p>
<p>The whole bunch of students was then split into four groups corresponding to the four IPC labs of the Computer Science Department. All the lab sessions were headed by senior experts of CRUx, while the individuals from the club volunteered to assist with coordination and to deal with any doubts and queries that the students had. </p>
<p>The workshop was 6 hours long and was separated into 2 segments. The initial, 3 hour period comprised of a prologue to the Python language and the different language designs. After an hour-long meal break, the second 3 hour long session had more hands-on coding exercises designed to give them a taste of Python data-types and the Object Oriented Paradigm with Python.</p>
<h4 id="advanced-workshops">Advanced Workshops</h4>
<p>The Advanced workshops were conducted in one of the larger lecture halls, with 237 attendees working on their own laptops. The necessary environment setup instructions had been put up on the website earlier, and volunteers were available to help with on-spot installations as well. The first 3 hour session on Flask was conducted by Mr. Malhar Latkar, an experienced Programming Technologies Trainer. He provided starter code for each topic, and this made it much easier for the audience to focus on the concept and learn via experimentation. He started out with an explanation of the Flask framework, and a basic Hello World program with Flask. From there, a variety of topics ranging from routing and URL building, to templates and session handling, and flask extensions such as database interfacing were covered. The session ended with a how-to on deploying Flask application to cloud services such as AWS and Heroku.</p>
<p>After an hour long lunch break, we commenced with the Scrapy session. Despite some internet speed related issues due to the number of attendees, most of them were able to follow along with the instructor, Mr. Mohammad Sajid, Founder of Step-Up Analytics, and obtain the desired output on their devices. He opened by explaining the need for scraping and explaining some common use cases in the industry. He targeted shopclues.com, an e-commerce website, in order to explain the various features of the library - Scrapy spiders, item pipelines, link extractors and automated crawlers, to name a few.</p>
<h3 id="summary-and-reviews">Summary and Reviews</h3>
<p>Participants were pleased with the ease of the registration process, punctuality and the overall hospitality extended by the host institute. Conference goers liked the venue, and the speakers&#39; demonstrations along with their talks. In fact, Mr. Saikat Dey gave his IoT talk through a Raspberry Pi Zero connected to the projector via HDMI. People were happy with the overall mix of programming-heavy and non-programming talks.</p>
<p>As for the basic workshop, the school students enjoyed it thoroughly. It was a refreshing break from the mundane academic courses, and a significant amount expressed their interest in pursuing Computer Science in higher studies. Their accompanying teachers said they would like to continue bringing their wards for similar future events, since it was a great learning experience.</p>
<p>Among our attendees, we also had a seventh-grade student who participated the advanced workshop with his father. It was surprising, and heartening, to see his interest in the world of programming at such a young age. And if his response is something to go by, we believe the audience was able to absorb the instructors&#39; teachings quite well.</p>
<p>Amulya, from Srinidhi Institute of Technology, had this to state - &quot;The workshop was totally worth it. Last year I attended the basic Python workshop and this time the advanced ones. What&#39;s more satisfying is that I got to get in touch with the geniuses like Sajid Sir and Malhar Sir and talking to them has instilled a greater passion in me for this field.&quot;</p>
<p>Anurag, a fellow BITSian in his sophomore year said - &quot;The speakers were very learned and their points were hands-on. Frankly, it was more like an informal session where every doubt was encouraged and participants spoke their mind. Yes, I learned a considerable measure about Python and the to-dos of the terminal, which were quite different from C&#39;s.&quot;</p>
<p>The event ended with a content audience, now with an extra sticker or two on their laptops. Most stayed behind to enjoy some of the other events on offer as part of ATMOS, and the concert by &quot;The Local Train&quot;. From a networking point of view, many were able to find collaborators for projects of mutual interest, including the speakers themselves.</p>
<h3 id="organizer-s-notes">Organizer&#39;s Notes</h3>
<p>For the most part, we feel the event went off without any major hitches. Thankfully, we did not have to put any of our contingency plans into effect. There were no reported, or observed, Code of Conduct violations. External variables such as flights and cabs were on time.</p>
<p>The minor hitch was internet strength. Our bandwidth was not able to support the crowd of the workshops and fest events combined, and so we experienced slow speeds and slight downtime issues. We managed with portable hotspots and by covering topics without online dependencies during that period.</p>
<p>We also hoped to conduct sprints this time. However, an already packed schedule for attendees, combined with the infeasibility of conducting sprints on a weekday, forced us to forgo them this time. We hope to factor these conditions in for the next edition.</p>
